            <h1>Developer Program</h1>  <br><hr><br>
            <p>Pi Network has always been driven by the decentralized efforts from Pioneers, the Core Team, and community developers alike. 
                This collaborative spirit continues through the Developer Ambassador Program, an initiative that enables the community to
                 mobilize their utilities-building efforts by enrolling new developers onto Pi Network, and support its vision: <br>

                Build the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, fueled by Pi, the world’s most widely 
                distributed cryptocurrency. <br> 
                
                This program is for everyone. Whether or not you are a developer yourself, any Pioneer can be proactive in identifying, 
                engaging and enabling developers in their personal and professional networks to build new Pi apps (or repurpose existing
                 apps into Pi apps) for our large 47+ million strong community. <br>
                
                Your efforts in this Developer Ambassador Program can help create new Pi Apps and further diversify the utilities of the
                 Pi cryptocurrency, bringing us closer to Open Mainnet, all the while bringing you Pi rewards! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content2">
            <h1>Developer Reward</h1>
            <p>Creating utilities and advancing to the next phase of the Pi roadmap is an essential network goal. 
                To incentivize and reward this mass effort, Developer Ambassadors will receive 1000 Pi for every 
                new Pioneer developer they onboard who builds and deploys an unverified Mainnet Pi app that is
                 listed on the Ecosystem UI of the Pi Browser. This program is meant to only reward sincere efforts
                  that advance the network’s goals. Therefore, the reward will only be given when your invited 
                  developers build and deploy real apps.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content3">
            <h1>Program Details</h1>
            <p>In this initial program, Developer Ambassadors have until March 31, 2024 to invite developers to create and 
                list an unverified Mainnet app on the Pi Browser's Ecosystem UI. Developer Ambassadors can manage invitations
                 and track the progress of onboarded developers in the Developer Ambassador interface, found in the main Pi 
                 app's menu bar under the "Roles" tab.  <br>

                The Developer Ambassador can obtain the Pi rewards only if the invited new developer successfully builds a Pi 
                app. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content4">
            <h1>Eligibility</h1> <br>
            <p>Specifically, for the Developer Ambassador to be eligible to receive the reward of 1000 Pi, the new Pioneer developer needs to: <br>

               1. Join Pi Network using the Developer Ambassador’s general Pi Network referral code (the same one to invite new Pioneers). <br>
                
               2. Register an app on the Developer Portal within 30 days of becoming a Pioneer.  <br>
                
               3. Have their unverified Mainnet app meet the listing criteria of, and be successfully listed on, the Ecosystem UI of the Pi Browser for at least 30 continuous days.  <br>
                
                Details on the Ecosystem UI of the Pi Browser and the requirements to be listed on it as an unverified Mainnet App will be provided later. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content5">
            <h1>Find, Pitch, Onboard and Support Developers</h1>
            <p>There are four key components to being a successful Developer Ambassador: finding great developers, pitching the Pi platform and community to them,
                 onboarding them onto the platform, and supporting them to build strong apps. In this section, we will provide you with resources on how to complete
                  all of these steps!</p> <br>
                  <span class="points">
                    <h3>1. Find Developers</h3> <br>
                    <p>As a Developer Ambassador, you have the freedom to invite developers and businesses from any background to Pi. Here are some suggestions for how to get started: <br>

                       => Reach out to friends, family, colleagues and peers with a background in software development, software engineering, product design or entrepreneurship <br>
                        
                       => Connect with startups and companies who have an app or are interested in building an app or an online presence <br>
                        
                       => Tap into your university, workplace, or professional networks  <br>
                        
                       => Look out for both existing apps with a proven model, as well as developers who may want to build a Pi app from scratch  <br>
                        
                        If you have access to a network of developers, you could host gatherings or even your own local hackathon to get multiple parties to start building Pi Apps!  <br>
                        No matter where you find developers, remember to prioritize one-on-one conversations as you are able to directly respond to the developers’ potential questions or concerns. </p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="points">
                    <h3>2. Pitch to Developers</h3>  <br>
                    <p>It is important to provide prospective developers with an informative and 
                        compelling introduction to Pi. The key attractions of the Pi platform and 
                        community for developers are explained in this Why Build on Pi webpage. <br>

                        It is best to also be able to provide a summary of the benefits of building a Pi App yourself.
                         Some of the main benefits of developing a Pi App include:  <br>
                        
                       => Access to over 47 million potential users  <br>
                        
                       => Simple Web3 onboarding without need for any blockchain or cryptocurrency-specific programming language or experience  <br>
                        
                       => Quick start with built-in developer tools and community contributions  <br>
                        
                       => Multiple revenue options allowing for diverse business models  <br>
                        
                       => Limitless development – build anything the developer wants <br>
                        
                       => Opportunities for support, mentorship, and Pi cryptocurrency rewards <br>
                        
                       => Low transaction fees and high throughput on this environmentally friendly blockchain <br>
                        
                        With PiNet—Pi Apps on the Open InterNet—Developer Ambassadors have an excellent toolkit and proof
                         point to use in your pitch to developers you want to onboard onto Pi Network. PiNet is an easy way 
                         to view and share Pi Apps on any regular web browser such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on any device
                          without needing to sign in with the Pi account. It allows the developer to explore parts of the Pi App
                           ecosystem even before they have a Pi account. For example, sharing Fireside Forum via PiNet can give 
                           a developer a sense of a useful Pi App as well as the level of Pioneer engagement on the platform, 
                           helping motivate the developer to build a Pi App of their own.  <br>
                
                        To share PiNet.com links, simply copy the PiNet URL directly from your browser and share with the developer.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="points">
                    <h3>3. Onboard Developers</h3>  <br>
                    <p>Send interested developers your general Pi Network referral code (the same one to invite new Pioneers) to create
                         their Pi account. This way, you are identified as their Developer Ambassador. You also can send them an invite
                          link directly through the Developer Ambassador Portal. This is found in the Pi mining app by accessing the 
                          side menu icon ☰, then tapping on the “Roles” button, then tapping on the “Developer Ambassador Program”, 
                          and then tapping on “Add from Contacts”.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="points">
                    <h3>4. Support Developerss</h3>  <br>
                    <p>It is easy to get started and build on Pi. Unlike on other blockchains, a software developer
                         does not need prior blockchain experience or knowledge of any blockchain-specific programming language.
                          As the developer invited by you starts building a Pi App, you can share the following developer resources 
                          to support their building of a Pi App along the way.
                    </p>
